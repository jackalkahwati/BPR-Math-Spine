Boundary Phase Resonance: Emergent Physical Phenomena from Stabilized Phase Structures on Constrained Boundaries

\vspace{1em}
Dear Editorial Office,

Thank you for your feedback. We have addressed both issues as follows:

\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{1. Supporting Information.} We have attached the Supporting Information as a separate PDF file (SI Appendix). The manuscript references SI Appendix, Section~7 (Higgs quartic coupling derivation); this section is now included in the attached file.

\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{2. Abstract mismatch.} We have amended the manuscript so that the abstract in the manuscript file matches the abstract in the online submission form exactly.

\vspace{1em}
We have uploaded the revised manuscript PDF and SI Appendix with this response. Please let us know if any further changes are needed.

\vspace{1em}
Sincerely,\\
Jack Al-Kahwati
