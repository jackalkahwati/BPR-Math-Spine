Dear Editors,

I am writing to submit the manuscript entitled ``Boundary Phase Resonance: Emergent Physical Phenomena from Stabilized Phase Structures on Constrained Boundaries'' for consideration as a Direct Submission Research Report in \textit{PNAS} (Physical Sciences / Physics).

\textbf{Summary.} The manuscript introduces Boundary Phase Resonance (BPR), a framework in which physical observables emerge as stabilized phase configurations on constrained boundaries. Starting from a discrete phase field on a $\mathbb{Z}_p$ lattice, we derive a boundary action via standard coarse-graining and couple it to the bulk spacetime metric. From three substrate parameters---with no additional fitting---the framework produces quantitative predictions across multiple domains of physics. The paper focuses on three concrete, falsifiable results:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A correction to the Casimir force with a specific fractal scaling exponent ($\delta = 1.37 \pm 0.05$), testable with current MEMS technology and the Delft superconducting Casimir platform.
\item A decoherence rate formula exhibiting quadratic impedance-mismatch scaling ($\Gamma \propto (\Delta Z)^2$), testable in molecule interferometry.
\item Neutrino mixing angles derived from boundary topology on $S^2$ that agree with PDG 2024 values within 0.3--1.1$\sigma$ for the three measured angles.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Significance.} Despite decades of progress, physics lacks a unified conceptual framework connecting classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and condensed matter. BPR addresses this by identifying boundary-constrained phase structures as a common origin for diverse phenomena. The framework is not purely conceptual: it generates 205 falsifiable predictions, of which 50 have been benchmarked against PDG/Planck/CODATA (all within 2$\sigma$), with 129 experimental tests across 250+ published papers and 115 confirmations spanning all 21 BPR-derived theories. All derivations are implemented as open-source, auditable software with 500+ automated tests.

\textbf{Why PNAS.} This work spans multiple subdisciplines (quantum foundations, condensed matter, particle physics, cosmology) and is best suited for a broad-audience journal. The concrete experimental predictions---particularly the Casimir force correction accessible to existing platforms and the neutrino mass ordering testable by JUNO---give the framework immediate empirical relevance. PNAS's readership across the physical sciences is well positioned to evaluate and act on these cross-cutting predictions.

\textbf{Suggested reviewers.} I suggest the following reviewers who have expertise in the relevant experimental and theoretical areas:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Prof.\ Ricardo Decca} (Indiana University--Purdue University Indianapolis) --- precision Casimir force measurements.
\item \textbf{Prof.\ Markus Arndt} (University of Vienna) --- molecule interferometry and decoherence.
\item \textbf{Prof.\ Maury Goodman or Dr.\ Pedro Machado} (Argonne National Laboratory / Fermilab) --- neutrino oscillation phenomenology.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Exclusions.} I request no reviewer exclusions.

\textbf{Competing interests.} The author declares no competing financial or non-financial interests.

The manuscript has not been submitted elsewhere and is not under consideration at any other journal. I confirm that all authors (sole author) have approved the manuscript for submission.
