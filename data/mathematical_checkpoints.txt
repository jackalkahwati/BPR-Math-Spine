BPR Mathematical Checkpoints (No-FEniCS Mode)
=============================================

Checkpoint 1: Laplacian eigenvalue convergence
Status: SKIPPED (requires FEniCS mesh generation)

Checkpoint 2: Energy-momentum conservation
Status: FAILED (symbolic verification)

Checkpoint 3: Standard Casimir recovery
Status: PASSED (analytical scaling)

Note: Limited verification without FEniCS.
For complete validation, install FEniCS and run full demo.
